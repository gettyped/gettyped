The site is written in [[http://orgmode.org][Org mode]] and its various components are generated from
there.

- HTML   :: Published by [[https://github.com/jedahu/orgen][Orgen]].
- Source :: Extracted by [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/][Babel]]. Compiled and tested by [[http://www.scala-sbt.org][sbt]].
- Demos  :: Uploaded by [[http://defunkt.io/gist/][gist]]. Run by [[http://www.scala-js-fiddle.com][Scala-Js-Fiddle]].

Most examples are written in [[http://scala-lang.org][Scala]] because it has:
- familiar syntax for most programmers,
- convenient encoding of sum types,
- higher kinded types,
- at least some tail call optimization, and
- a [[https://www.scala-js.org][Javascript backend]].
